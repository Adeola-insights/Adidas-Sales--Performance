# Adidas-Sales--Performance
# Project Overview
This project analyzes Adidas sales data using Microsoft Excel to build an interactive dashboard that tracks sales performance, operating profit, and growth trends across time, geography, products, and sales channels.
The dashboard is designed to support business decision-making by highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying top-performing regions and products, and evaluating year-over-year (YoY) performance.
# Business Objectives
* Track overall business performance using core KPIs
* Analyze sales and operating profit trends over time
* Identify top-performing states and products
* Understand sales distribution across channels
* Measure year-over-year growth and recovery patterns
# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of transactional sales records with the following attributes:
* Retailer / Retailer ID
* Invoice Date (Year, Month)
* Region, State, City
* Product Category
* Price per Unit
* Units Sold
* Total Sales
* Operating Profit
* Sales Method
#  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Sales: $899.9M
Total Units Sold: 2.5M
Total Operating Profit: $332.1M
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:
Sales
Units Sold
Operating Profit
The Operating Profit is treated as an absolute monetary metric and is aggregated using SUM.![ad 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2355cbb9-2407-4432-9262-e83d5f1df401)![ad 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f8936df-7b92-4d00-b7aa-186a8c3d6a4b)

#  Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Analysis
The dashboard shows significant YoY growth across sales, units sold, and operating profit. This outcome is mathematically valid and business-justified, driven primarily by a low base effect in the prior year.
Analysis from the Data:
Aggregated yearly metrics show that the base year recorded substantially lower sales and profit
Subsequent growth is consistent across months, not driven by isolated spikes
Sales growth aligns with increases in units sold and operating profit, confirming realistic performance
# Business View
The low base year coincides with a period of major retail disruption, including:
Reduced consumer demand
Store closures and limited physical retail activity
Supply chain constraints
As conditions improved in the following year, the business experienced a strong recovery, resulting in amplified YoY percentages.
* High YoY growth in this analysis represents:
Business recovery from a weak baseline
Rebound in consumer demand
Improved operational performance
Rather than indicating an anomaly, the YoY metrics provide valuable context when interpreted alongside absolute KPIs such as total sales and operating profit.
# Tools & Skills used
* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables
* Pivot Charts
* Calculated Fields
* Slicers
* Dashboard Design & Formatting
 # Importance
Adidas achieved strong overall performance with nearly $900M in total sales
Operating profit of $332.1M reflects healthy operational efficiency
Sales growth is driven by top-performing states and core product categories
High YoY growth reflects recovery and expansion.
The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of performance drivers
#  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to transform raw sales data into a structured, insight-driven dashboard.
It highlights core data analysis skills including KPI design, trend analysis, YoY evaluation, and business storytelling.
